            From a stunning first sentence to a perfect string of dialogue,
            there are certain parts of books that feel particularly memorable.
            And whether they make us laugh, cry, or simply reflect, these
            quotable lines have a habit of sticking with us long after we turn
            the final page. Read on for some of the best book quotes we won’t
            ever forget.

            idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It’s when you

            to break up the pandemic tedium with a little bit of competition,
            and also because it’s fun, I’ve picked out 100 of the most
            referenced , quoted, reused, and generally well-known passages of
            literature, from single memorable lines of dialogue to longer
            sections of prose or verse, and turned them into a quiz
